This course will address operations strategy by building on the concepts of:

1.  Reengineering and process design developed by Dr. Michael Hammer.
2.  Manufacturing strategy as developed in the literature, primarily by people at HBS.
3.  Supply chain design and 3-D concurrent engineering literature as developed in Charles Fine’s book, _Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage._ Perseus Books, 1999.

The concepts there emphasize the necessity of integrating product strategy, manufacturing strategy, and supply chain strategy. As a result, each of these will be touched upon in the course.
